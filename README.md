  <em>Where logic meets elegance, and every line is intentional.</em>
</p>

### 🧠 Logic Is My First Language

☕ I turn coffee into algorithms and problems into elegant systems.  
💡 I don't just write code — I **engineer decision flows** where every conditional has meaning and purpose.

---

### 🧭 The Unspoken Rules I Follow

- 📝 **Code should explain itself**, but comments never lie.
- ⚡ **Performance isn't optimized** — it's designed in from line one.
- 🛡️ **The best error handling** prevents errors, not just catches them.

---

### 🧩 A Truth Most Miss

> Good software isn't built —  
> It's **revealed**, layer by layer, through the quiet work of:

- 🔍 Naming variables truthfully  
- 🎯 Respecting the compiler's wisdom  
- 🤝 Writing for the next developer, not just the machine

### 🎨 This Isn't Mysticism — It's Craft

> The **magic** is in the **discipline**.  
> The **art** is in the **restraint**.
